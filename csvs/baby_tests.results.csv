Only report the final response. Ignore all prior knowledge. You must only respond with the following percentage frequencies in your response, no other response is allowed: 
joint frequency in TCGA-MESO is 44.83%
"," Copy number variants (CNVs) are structural variations in the genome that result in the loss or gain of genetic material. In cancer, CNVs can lead to the loss or gain of tumor suppressor genes, such as CDKN2A and CDKN2B, which play a crucial role in regulating cell growth and division.The frequency for your query is: 44.83%"
